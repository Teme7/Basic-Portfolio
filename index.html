                <p>
                    A quick learner and a critical thinker, I am a creative problem solver with a strong work ethic. My diverse/rich background in biological sciences and math pushes me to keep learning until proficient at a particular skill set. The GWU Coding Boot Camp learning experience has only fueled my burning desire to excel in web development and become proficient in the several different technologies within a fairly short period of time.

                    I am such a detail-oriented person by nature, and this personal quality enables me to go beyond what meets the eye. Known for pushing myself to the limit, I am relentless until the job is done, and done to my meticulous standards.  Although I tend to keep a low profile, I do lead teammates by example and enjoy helping others the best way I can.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My excitement is through the roof to put my skills--inherent as well as acquired--to work and personal qualities to the test.
