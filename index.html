                                A quick learner and a critical thinker,
                                I am a creative problem solver with a strong 
                                work ethic. My diverse/rich background in biological
                                sciences and math pushes me to keep learning until 
                                proficient at a particular skill set. The GWU Coding 
                                Boot Camp learning experience has only fueled my 
                                burning desire to excel in web development and become
                                proficient in the several different technologies
                                    within a fairly short period of time.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                I am such a detail-oriented person by nature, and this
                                personal quality enables me to go beyond what meets 
                                the eye. Known for pushing myself to the limit, I am
                                relentless until the job is done, and done to my 
                                meticulous standards.  Although I tend to keep a low 
                                profile, I do lead teammates by example and enjoy 
                                helping others the best way I can.
                            </p>
            
                            <p>
                                My excitement is through the roof to put my skills--inherent
                                as well as acquired--to work and personal qualities to the test.
                            </p>
